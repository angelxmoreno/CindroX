 * CookCommandCommand generates a new CLI command file using Plop templates.

 * This command mimics CakePHPâ€™s "bake" functionality but uses the term "cook".
 * It loads the TypeScript plop file (e.g., located at src/plop-generators/index.ts),
 * retrieves the generator named "command", and runs it with the provided command name.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun cindrox cook:command <name>
 *
 * Example:
 *   bun cindrox cook:command HelloCommand
