 * CookMiddlewareCommand generates a new Hono middleware file using Plop templates.

 * This command mimics CakePHPâ€™s "bake" functionality (using the term "cook")
 * and loads the TypeScript plop file (e.g., located at src/plop-generators/index.ts),
 * retrieves the generator named "middleware", and runs it with the provided middleware name.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun cindrox cook:middleware <name>
 *
 * Example:
 *   bun cindrox cook:middleware Auth
